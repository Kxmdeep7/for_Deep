        <div class="paragraph">
            I’ve been thinking about how to say this for a while, but I wanted to wait until the words felt right. I didn’t want to rush it, because some things are better said slowly.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I’ve always felt there was something rare about you. You have this quiet strength that doesn't need to be loud to be noticed. Being around you just makes the world feel a bit calmer, and I've always valued that about you.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Even when things are quiet, I still feel that influence. It’s a good kind of quiet—the kind that stays with you and changes the way everything else feels.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I’m not writing this to ask for anything or to complicate things. I just wanted to be honest and acknowledge the person you are. Some connections don’t need a label; they just need to be met with a sincere thank you.
        </div>

        <div class="closing-wish">
            I truly hope life is being kind to you.
        </div>

        <div class="signature">
            In shared silence,
        </div>
